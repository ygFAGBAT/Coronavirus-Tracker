# Coronavirus-Tracker

This is a web application to track total comfirmed cases across the global.


Use CVS based data to create a web application and use Spring Boot frame to show the data everyday as well as difference from previous day data.

From the application, we could see province/state, country, total confirmed cases and difference from previous day cases.
At the begining of the page, there is a data showing that total reported cases as "today" and how many cases increasing from previous day.
